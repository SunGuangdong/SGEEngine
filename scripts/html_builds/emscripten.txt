After emsdk has been installed and activated (see emscripten docs for more info) to configure CMake run this.

mkdir game_embin
cd game_embin
cmake D:\sge_source -G Ninja -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=D:\work\emsdk\upstream\emscripten\cmake\Modules\Platform\Emscripten.cmake

make did not worked on windows, this is why Ninja is used for build system. Visual Studio just compiles with the regular compiler.

Note that the location of that Emscripten.cmake file might change with the different version of emsdk.
This file is needed to tell cmake where the emcc (the compiler) and liker are and tell cmake that we're build for emscripten.

and then to build with ninja

ninja <GameProjectName>

Starting an http server locally from the cmd with python3. It is needed so the game data files could be loaded:
Do this where the html files is (its just easier you could pick another dir it should not matter0>

python -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1

Emscripten generates a default HTML files. For a version with most of its things stripped use the index.html here.
To use it just replace the referenced js file here <script async src=CharacterGame.js></script> to the one you need.
